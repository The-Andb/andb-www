# Andb Landing Page

This repository contains the source code for the official landing page of **Andb** - The Simplest Database Migration Tool.

It is designed to be a lightweight, high-performance static site hosting:

- 🚀 Product Features Showcase
- 🖼️ Application Screenshots (Dynamic 3D Carousel)
- 📥 Official Download Links (Coming Soon)
- 🌓 Dark/Light Mode previews

## Key Links

- **Andb Core**: [The-Andb/andb-core](https://github.com/The-Andb/andb-core)

## 🛠️ Development

The landing page (`index.html`) is built with:

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN for zero-build setup)
- **Lucide Icons**
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (for the 3D Carousel & Theme Toggle logic)

### Editing

Simply open `index.html` in your browser to preview changes. No build step required.

### Screenshots

Screenshots in `screenshots/` are automatically generated from the main application using an Electron automation script to ensure they are always up-to-date with the latest UI.
